# UMG Challenges - Dec'18

## Dec 1-2 Thought Starters

**Theme**: Re-imagining Music Consumption and Discovery

_If you have an idea for a new Alexa skill, AR/VR immersive experience, music gamification app or Twitch extension, fan engagement tool, etc. and are in need of content or artists to experiment with, this Hackathon is perfect for you. We have two category challenges but all ideas you have at the intersection of music and tech are fair game!_  

1. **Consumption**: Re-imagine ways of embedding music experiences into consumption platforms \(e.g Create Twitch Extensions and new music apps at the intersection of gaming, augmented reality, and music\)
2. **Discovery**: Re-imagine ways of using emerging tech to change the music discovery process for fans \(e.g. e-Sports playlisting, voice discovery\)
