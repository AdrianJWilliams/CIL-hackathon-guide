The first-ever Capitol Innovation Labs Hackathon brings together coders, developers, hackers, artists, designers and tech specialists for 24 hours of intense work, debates, brainstorming, innovation, camaraderie and fun! Each team is invited to formulate solutions to problems and create new pathways to move the music industry forward

We're hackers too, so we know your time at the hackathon is limited. That's why we've developed this guide to help you harness our technology to realize your ideas in the most efficient way possible.
