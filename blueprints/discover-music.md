The app provides an interactive Vue-based front-end, which allows you to search and sort your way through a massive music catalog, supplied by 7Digital. Notable features:

* Album and artist images are cropped, padded, optimized and delivered using Cloudinary
* Artists, albums, and tracks are fetched using the [Music Discovery Service API](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/music-discovery-service), which Cloudinary built just for this hackathon.
* The front-end is powered by Vue; notable components include [Vue-APlayer](https://vue-aplayer.js.org), and [vue-social-sharing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-social-sharing).

Feel free to use, modify and extend this blueprint apps for your Hack.
