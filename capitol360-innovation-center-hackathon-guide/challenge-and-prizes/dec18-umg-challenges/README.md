# Dec'18 UMG Challenges

## D**ecember 2018 Thought Starters** <a id="june-2-3-thought-starters"></a>

### **Theme**: Re-imagining Music Consumption and Discovery

_If you have an idea for a new Alexa skill, AR/VR immersive experience, music gamification app or Twitch extension, fan engagement tool, etc. and are in need of content or artists to experiment with, this Hackathon is perfect for you. We have two category challenges but all ideas you have at the intersection of music and tech are fair game!_  

1. **Consumption**: Re-imagine ways of embedding music experiences into consumption platforms \(e.g Create Twitch Extensions and new music apps at the intersection of gaming, augmented reality, and music\)
   * Design and develop an immersive music experience that can only exist with 5G. Over the course of the weekend, your team will be challenged to push the boundaries of immersive music experiences. Consider the music video of the future and unique ways to integrate spatialized audio and motion capture into music experiences. At the end of the weekend, your team should develop a proof of concept prototype, made possible by motion capture and spatial audio capture, with processing over 5G
2. **Discovery**: Re-imagine ways of using emerging tech to change the music discovery process for fans \(e.g. e-Sports playlisting, voice discovery\)
