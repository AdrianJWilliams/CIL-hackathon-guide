# Dec'18 UMG Challenges

## D**ecember 2018 Thought Starters** <a id="june-2-3-thought-starters"></a>

### **Theme**: Re-imagining Music Consumption and Discovery

_If you have an idea for a new Alexa skill, AR/VR immersive experience, music gamification app or Twitch extension, fan engagement tool, etc. and are in need of content or artists to experiment with, this Hackathon is perfect for you. We have two category challenges but all ideas you have at the intersection of music and tech are fair game!_  

1. **Consumption**: Re-imagine ways of embedding music experiences into consumption platforms \(e.g Create Twitch Extensions and new music apps at the intersection of gaming, augmented reality, and music\)
   * Design and develop an immersive music experience that can only exist with 5G. Over the course of the weekend, your team will be challenged to push the boundaries of immersive music experiences. Consider the music video of the future and unique ways to integrate spatialized audio and motion capture into music experiences. At the end of the weekend, your team should develop a proof of concept prototype, made possible by motion capture and spatial audio capture, with processing over 5G
2. **Discovery**: Re-imagine ways of using emerging tech to change the music discovery process for fans \(e.g. e-Sports playlisting, voice discovery\)



### **VERIZON 5G CHALLENGE**

_**Creative Brief \(Participant Facing\)**_  

_Design and develop an immersive music experience over 5G._  
Verizon's fifth-generation \(5G\) wireless network will transform almost every industry. 5G will provide up to 1,000 times the bandwidth of today’s 4G LTE network and 20 times faster speeds along with near-instantaneous responsiveness. 5G will undoubtedly disrupt the end user experience, but 5G also has the potential to completely transform the creative production process. 5G will decrease production time for compute-intensive processes like motion capture, spatial audio, and volumetric video. As a result, we’re able to prototype with these new technologies in faster, more efficient ways.  
  
For Capitol’s HackFest 360, you will collaborate with an up-and-coming music artist to prototype and push the boundaries of immersive music experiences using the power of 5G to accelerate the development process. Consider the music video of the future and unique ways to integrate spatialized audio and motion capture into music experiences.  
  
At the end of the weekend, your team should develop a proof of concept prototype, made possible by motion capture and spatial audio capture over Verizon’s 5G network. Your final deliverable should be an immersive music experience developed in Unity as an Android app.  
  
_**Technical Details for Participants \(Participant Facing\)**_   
  
Verizon and RYOT will provide each team with a library of assets and shaders. One asset can be animated using Mocap and modified with shaders in post production. Verizon and RYOT will hire one professional dancer to be on hand, in a Mocap suit that each team will have an allotted amount of time to work with. Each team will also kick off the hackathon with a prebaked 3D hologram asset of the artist to include in their experience. The final deliverable should be a 360 experience in the form of an android app. Since  
  
1. Assets that Verizon and RYOT will provide as a participant package for the HackFest 

a. Volumetric Clip of Artist to incorporate into the scene \(:30-1:00\) 

b. Digital Mannequin and Professional dancer to animate mannequin 

c. Stems for the song being used \(Capitol to provide\) 

d. Shader library: Matte, Shiny, Luminescent, Realistic \(wood, marble, concrete, rust\) 

e. Virtual environment \(e.g. photo studio, sound stage, etc.\) 

f. Select props/practicals \(e.g. light rigs, scaffolding, etc.\)  
  


2. Assets produced at the HackFest 

a. Teams will compile their experiences in the virtual environment \(provided\) and add in elements of spatial audio. There are many opportunities to get creative with composition, surfacing, sound, environment construction, etc. 

b. Each project should be exported as an Android Build by the end of the HackFest

c. Option to spacialize the audio
