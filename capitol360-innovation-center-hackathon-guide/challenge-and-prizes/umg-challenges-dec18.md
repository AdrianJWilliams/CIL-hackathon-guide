# UMG Challenges

## **December 2018 Thought Starters** <a id="june-2-3-thought-starters"></a>

### **Theme**: Re-imagining Music Consumption and Discovery

_If you have an idea for a new Alexa skill, AR/VR immersive experience, music gamification app or Twitch extension, fan engagement tool, etc. and are in need of content or artists to experiment with, this Hackathon is perfect for you. We have two category challenges but all ideas you have at the intersection of music and tech are fair game!_  

1. **Consumption**: Re-imagine ways of embedding music experiences into consumption platforms \(e.g Create Twitch Extensions and new music apps at the intersection of gaming, augmented reality, and music\)
   * Design and develop an immersive music experience that can only exist with 5G. Over the course of the weekend, your team will be challenged to push the boundaries of immersive music experiences. Consider the music video of the future and unique ways to integrate spatialized audio and motion capture into music experiences. At the end of the weekend, your team should develop a proof of concept prototype, made possible by motion capture and spatial audio capture, with processing over 5G
2. **Discovery**: Re-imagine ways of using emerging tech to change the music discovery process for fans \(e.g. e-Sports playlisting, voice discovery\)







##  **June 2018 Thought Starters** <a id="june-2-3-thought-starters"></a>

1. Build an immersive catalog experience for Wayne Shorter
2. Build an A&R Research Tool that can help us identify the small pockets of momentum globally. \(e.g. Heat map of band camp data / live metrics\)
3. Build a tool to help improve licensing / rights management processes \(optional incorporate Blockchain\)
4. Other strategic priorities for UMG: Bots, messaging, gamification \| Playlisting tools \| Unique artist marketing tools
5. AR/VR - UMG's Music to create 3D mixes and interactive, 3D experiences for an Augmented Reality \(AR\) platform we are building. VR database of playabale music
6. Voice – Create skills that uniquely drive music discovery by voice
7. Spotify hack – we’ve gotten lots of complaints that artists are unable to share a specific track of their via a playlist link. Instead when they share, it just takes you to the top of the playlist page rather than direct to streaming. Not a full time project most likely but if anyone can figure this out as a side project, this request has come our way from senior management
8. Create fun applications that merge video and music
